New directory layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The scripts in mop/admin/ need debugging

Evaluator
~~~~~~~~~
interactive tasks: solve deadlocks?
interactive tasks: logging of messages
terminology: problem -> task ?

Judges
~~~~~~
test cases for judge-shuff

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
fpc: add switch -gl (runtime errors write line#), but avoid that when inside the sandbox

Installer:
- update group permissions
- quotas

New submitter:
- contest: task status cache

Various ideas:
scores dependent on time (like PL olympiad)
box: limit the total amount of data written to files, so that quotas don't have to be set up

TomGav
~~~~~~
recursive try-ln for dir input
clean and well-defined expansion (beware of per-test re-expansion)
configurable names of in/out files (independent of $PROBLEM)
paranoidly check file mode/owner before running the sandbox

Isolate
